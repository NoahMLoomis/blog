Left this morning at 6am from Montreal, my checked bag with sharp things missed the connection in Toronto. Thankfully I know better than to trust Air Canada and to put anything irreplaceable in a checked bag, so a trip to REI when I land in an hour should be able to replace my missing gear.

A flight attendant told me I have very pretty hair, which I was very flattered by, and was definitely the highlight of the day. Looking out the window of the plane I'm realizing that I'm going to walk from horizon to horizon, as far as I can see. And then some more. Feels pretty surreal.

The plan today is to make my way to the trailhead, where I'll camp out and start tommorow morning.

Now that there's a post up, if you go the to "Progress Tracker" on the blog it should show a pin, that if you click on, contains a link to this post, as well as a link to the weather (that's for you mom). 

For those of you who are following my trip VERY closely, I'd recommend not going crazy checking the blog every day. I'd say check once or twice a week max, and you won't miss much.

Hopefully the first week is smooth sailing, but things are more likely to go wrong than to not.

That's all for now,

Thanks for being a fan,
Noah
