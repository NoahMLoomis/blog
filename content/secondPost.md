6 days in, and I don't think I've ever been dirtier. 

Never having hiked in the desert, I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I wasn't expecting this amount of dirt and dust to get everywhere. Tiny miniscule dust particles that get whipped around by the wind that doesn't matter how well I pitch my tent, the dirt and dust gets in.

Thankfully yesterday I was able to hike into the first real town "Julian", where I had some free pie and was able to resupply , meet up with other hikers and hide out from the rain in a motel room for the night. We fit 8 people, most of them people I had only met in passing or even that day while eating pie in town.   Of the group there are 2 from Montreal (Myself and another), 1 from South Carolina, 1 from the UK, 1 from 3 hours north of Saskatoon, 2 people that have been living in their cars the last few years, and 1 from NYC. Very diverse, very funny group. I was finally able to shower, which was the best shower I've ever had. 

The wind over the last few days has been insane, walking along the ridges of these mountains, I haven't felt wind like it since Ireland.

Some people are waiting out the next 2-3 days in Julian, but I've decided to hitch a ride back the trail this morning with a few others and be miserably cold and wet in the next few days of intense wind and somewhat misty rain. There are free pancakes this morning at the trailhead this morning though, and that should hopefully make up for the next 3 days of lousy weather. 

The trail angel community on this trail is like no other (Trail angels are total strangers that offer rides  food, or supplies, all for free). Yesterday we needed to hitchhike into town from the trail (12 mile walk to town otherwise on a highway with no shoulder), and there was a trail angel waiting at the trailhead to give us a ride.

Overall, the trail has been awesome, and it feels impossible that it's only been a week 

Passed mile 50 a few days ago, only 2600 miles to go. 


Thanks for being a fan,
