## Why?

I watched <a target="_" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_(2014_film)">Wild</a> when I was 14, and it introduced me to the PCT. For some reason, watching a trauma ridden, alcoholic Reese Witherspoon made me want to hike the trail.

## What is the Pacific Crest Trail?

It's a trail that goes from Mexico to Canada, on the west coast. It goes through California, Oregon and Washington. It's 2,653 mi (4,270 km) long.

## How long will it take you?

Somewhere between 4-5 months. It's impossible to know exactly with all the unknown factors, such as my speed, health and overall fitness.

## Are you going with somebody?

No, I'm going alone. But it's a very popular trail and it's very common to make friends on the trail.

## What about food?

The PCT passes through (or close to) towns every 3-5 days, where I'll be able to resupply food and any gear I need. The longest food carry is 7-8 days. For the most part, I won't be shipping food to myself as I'll likely get tired of eating the same food, and it makes it harder to be flexible. I will be shipping certain gear boxes to myself, and maybe 1 or 2 resupply boxes where towns are very small and don't have much more than a gas station.

## Have you done trips like this before?

I've done 2 multi day hikes, the East Coast Trail (Newfoundland) in 10 days and the Sunshine Coast Trail (British Colombia) in 8.

## What are you bringing with you?

## What about animals?!

When you leave animals alone, they leave you alone. The biggest danger is bears eating your food, since if they do, they will think humans = food. I will be carrying a bear can in the areas required to mitigate this risk. There are snakes and scorpions in the desert, but the same philosophy applies.

## When are you leaving?

My current start date is ~~May 4th~~ March 26th 2025 (Changed the start date to be earlier).

## I have more questions!

Feel free to reach out, in person, online or over the phone. I'm happy to talk about the trip.
