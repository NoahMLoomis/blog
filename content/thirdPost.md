It hails.

Leaving Julian I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of bad weather. Sure the nights were close to freezing, but the days were sunny (but very windy) with small rain clouds, that were almost like you turned to the "misting" setting on a garden hose.

After a 2 days of walking along a mountain range that separates two huge valleys, I was surprised to be walking in flat green fields for a day. There were lots of cows. Then out of nowhere there was a community center right off the trail in Warner Springs, were you could buy hot pockets and other freezer food for 3$. I ate a lot of hot pockets. There was also an outdoor shower and a bucket to wash wash clothes. Truly felt like a luxury. Air drying after the shower was a bit chilly though.

From Warner Springs, we started the walk to Mt. San Jacinto which takes about 5 days. 

On the third day, it hailed. Luckily there was a trail angels place nearby that we could take shelter at "Mike's". The best way to describe this place is a mix between a horror movie junkyard and a cottage. It was not a very easy sleep, but the it was a shelter and good enough to not freeze. 

After a very low day, the next few days until the base of Mt. San Jacinto were awesome. I got trail magic (random acts of kindness from people) twice in one day, in the form of hot dogs, shade, a coke and donuts.


I had the world's biggest breakfast burrito at Paradise Valley Cafe, then started the 3 day hike up the montain. The first day was easy, and the second day was brutal. Up until now the elevation, even up to 6000 feet has been easy because of how gradual and well groomed the trail is, but the second day was steep switchbacks all day.

On the third day, the group I had been hiking with were planning on hiking into the nearby town Idlewild for a much deserved break, and summiting San Jacinto after a rest day. When I got to the turn off for the summit earlier than I was expecting, there was another thru hiker Ayo (doing the PCT in sandals) debating summiting or not. Since the PCT actually goes around the peak (at 8000 feet), you don't actually have to go to the top.

But me and Ayo (shoutout Ayo) decided to do it together to motivate ourselves. I dropped my pack, and hiked the mountain with him, the raced down to meet up with my earlier group who had now passed me and was at a motel in Idlewild. It was a huge day and was exhausted, but it was also the best day so far.


For anybody that thought "Ayo is a strange name", it's because that's not his real name. Thru hikers have a tradition of getting a "trail name", given to you by other hikers. The only rule is that is has to be accepted by the person receiving their name. Ayo is a trail name. So far I've met people named: Oats, Fish Fry, Sheppard, Veggie, Magic, Flash, Savage, Sauce, Fly Lord, Rainbow and many others that I can't remember right now. I don't know any of these peoples real names. There is always a story with how someone got their name. 

Some people have tried to give me the following trail names: Captain, Flyby, Kangaroo, Maple Cougar, and another I can't remember. None of them felt quite right to me, so I'm holding out for a trail name that I feel fits me best (I was close to accepting Maple Cougar though).

Today I took a zero (did no hiking) and hung around town, ate ice cream, drank beer with other hikers, and rested my feet. Tommorow I'm going back up the mountain to continue the trail. 

As always, thanks for being a fan,
Noah
