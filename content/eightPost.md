Leaving Bishop as a group again felt good. Though the previous week had been painfully cold at night, this week was promising to be warmer.

The schedule stayed the same. Every morning we left at 4am, but the warm weather overnight had the consequence of snow being softer. Waking up at 3:30am only to posthole through the snow anyways at 4am is extremely disheartening.

We also finally started seeing more wildlife! Small mouse, lots of unafraid marmots, and a few deer. Water crossings became a regular occurance (so did wet feet), and a few beautiful waterfalls. Some water crossings are ankle deep, but some are waist deep with fast moving water. 

During this time, the PCT and John Muir Trail (JMT) intersect. It is one of the most popular trails in the US, and for good reason. It has been by far the most beautiful hiking I have ever done. From walking along rivers overflowing from the melting snow to walking along mountain ridges, all day you're surrounded by incredible views. It's hard to remember to stop and look around.

7 days after Mammoth, we arrived at Vermillion Valley Resort, an odd little oasis in the woods. It started as a hunting leant-to 80 years ago, and has evolved to be a hikers resupply with a full kitchen. The food there was expensive, but also the best I've had on trail so far.

In the desert, doing less than 20 miles a day felt like a half day of hiking. In the Sierra's, doing more than 15 miles continuously is a big challenge.

Mammoth reminds me a lot of Mont Tremblant. It being a big ski town there's a lot of condos, fancy bikes and money.

There's only a week and a half left in the Sierra's, most of the hardest passes are already behind us, but it feels like I started the Sierra's only a week ago.

Arrived in Mammoth yesterday morning, and took today as a full zero day (no hiking). I'm looking forward to being back on the trail tommorow. Being in town is nice, but after more than a day I get ansty, and feel the pull to get back walking. Lots of pictures this time. 

Thanks for being a fan,
Noah
