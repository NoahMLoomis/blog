Finished 700 miles and made it to Kennedy Meadows.

This marks the end of the desert, and start of the Sierra's, the second section of the PCT. Officially more than a quarter of the way done. 

The last week from Tahachepie has been challenging. My shin splint healed, but I could've used an extra day to heal any niggles. Nonetheless, I was lucky and despite hiking, my shin splint continued to heal.

The most challenging part by far has been the heat. Sweating through your shirt and getting salt stains on it when it dries is a new experience. Due to the heat, we ended up taking a nearo (near zero) day in Ridgecrest where we stayed at a trail angels, Sergio. Not only does Sergio stock an important water cache, but he also hosts hikers in his house.

Finally we made it to Kennedy Meadows. It's a famous stop as it marks the start of the Sierra's, but also because you get to see everybody you've passed on trail over the last few weeks, and the people who have passed you. It's a really fun atmosphere, and I've played a lot of euchre over the last 2 days. 

It's been fun hanging out here, but I'm ready for the Sierra's, and are eager to climb Mt. Whitney in a few days time. We picked up bear cans, ice axes, and crampons. Ready as we will be.

Thanks for being a fan,
Noah
